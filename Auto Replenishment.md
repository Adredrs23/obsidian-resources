Hi Saurabh, 

Hope you are doing great.
This is regarding the current status of Configurator team.
We have completed the development for requested features planned so far and our bucketlist is almost empty.

We have discussed the same with Varad,Vivek & other members however we were unable to come up with next set of items bec -- 

We have highlighted the same to Varad, Vivek and other members of the team and haven't heard anything concrete 
on what to work on next.

Can you help us identify, align and priortize next action items for configurator so we can take it up in the next sprints. 
If needed we can schedule up a meeting with the team to discuss and plan out further steps.
```


Hi Abhishek,

Thanks for the initial brief and introduction about the project. 

Please find the minutes of meetings for the Sankey initial connect regarding Auto Replenishment dated 6th December, 2023.
Meeting attendees: @Apoorv @Akhilesh @Abhishek @shreyash

1. Discussed about the internal technical stack & tools being used by the analytics team.
2. Auto Replenishment might not just be limited to reporting.
3. Need to set up a meeting to discuss on the following points -
	1. Overall scope for the project.
	2. Use cases - Will that be restricted to Auto Replenishment only or can be flexible enough to address other use cases too.
	3. State of development - build on existing solutions or develop from beginning.
	4. Tools and architecture - Which tech stack and tools can be considered for the project.


@Saurabh, please let us know your availability for the second round of discussion so we can book your calendar accordingly.

Thanks and Regards,
