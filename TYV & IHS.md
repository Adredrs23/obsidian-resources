# TYV

### Punchline
1. Optimizing vehicle parking, location tracking and retrieval for leading automobile manufacturer in India.
2. Rethinking newly made vehicle storage management, tracking and retrieval for leading automobile manufacturer in India.

### Problem
Tedious and time consuming process of locating and parking factory ready vehicles inside premises. Prone to human errors and heavy paperwork. Getting location of any vehicle at any given instant is hard, tiresome and required multiple trips. No efficient way of tagging locations in premises adding to the challenges of vehicle parking visibility. Non TCU mapping of vehicles.

### Solution
Creating distinct zones in the premises also tagging them with areas help segregate and define premises into distinguishable sectors by using the technique of Geo-fencing. 
Parking and locating vehicles is supported by these digital zones providing current location of individual vehicles based on the last tagged location thus improving visibility and reducing the overhead of manual paperwork and multiple trips. Non TCU vehicles are tracked by use of mobile devices where the GPS position is used as last tagged location.

# IHS
### Punchline
Streamlining & Digitizing In-house sequencing process for leading automobile manufacturer in India.
### Problem
Existing manual, error prone sequencing of parts, reduce TAT and errors, digitalize, centralized, sequencing of parts for PV assembly lines. Effective way to sequence using organized trolleys and visibility for coverage and reports.
### Solution
Trolley configuration, mapping MES live data received to trolleys on real time basis improved efficiency. Maintaining centralized data and configurations with part images help reduced cognitive load on the operating user increasing efficiency, transparency and accountability.
### Impact
Eliminated manual work of printing dropping sequence from MES compiling data of part families and parts, segregation of data of part family wise. Reduce wastage of papers, Improved visibility of process and reduced rework for sequencing trollies
Dealing with1000+ papers per day and sequencing 30+ IHS and 7+ JIS part families


**Optimizing In-house Sequencing for Leading Automobile Manufacturer**

**Problem:**
We faced challenges with manual, error-prone sequencing of parts, resulting in extended Turnaround Time (TAT) and inefficiencies across Production Vehicle (PV) assembly lines. The goal was to establish an efficient, paperless, error-free method with organized sequencing, real-time visibility, and comprehensive reporting.

**Solution:**
We implemented a digitalized system, configuring specialized trolleys and integrating real-time data from the Manufacturing Execution System (MES). By centralizing data and providing visual aids such as part images, we significantly reduced the cognitive load on operators required to sequence the parts, thereby enhancing overall efficiency, transparency, and accountability within the system.

**Business Impact:**
Our solution eliminated manual tasks, reduced paper wastage, and enhanced process visibility, resulting in significant efficiency gains. Dealing with over 1000 papers daily and sequencing numerous part families, including 30+ IHS and 7+ JIS part families, our intervention streamlined operations for sustained success.


Impact for TYV
Improved Turn around time for dispatch
Fuel data visibility
Location on fingertips
less manual trips for location retrieving
Complete visibility of vehicle status in premises (CRTD, SFLT, WTCL)
