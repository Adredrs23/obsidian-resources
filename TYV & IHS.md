### Punchline
1. Optimizing vehicle parking, location tracking and retrieval for leading automobile manufacturer in India.
2. Rethinking newly made vehicle storage management, tracking and retrieval for leading automobile manufacturer in India.

### Problem
Tedious and time consuming process of locating and parking factory ready vehicles inside premises. Prone to human errors and heavy paperwork. Getting location of any vehicle at any given instant is hard, tiresome and required multiple trips. No efficient way of tagging locations in premises adding to the challenges of vehicle parking visibility. Non TCU mapping of vehicles.

### Solution
Creating distinct  zones in the premises also tagging them with areas help segregate and define premises into distinguishable sectors by using the technique of Geo-fencing. 
Parking and locating vehicles is supported by these digital zones providing current location of individual vehicles based on the last tagged location thus improving visibility and reducing the overhead of manual paperwork and multiple trips. Non TCU vehicles are tracked by use of mobile devices where the GPS position is used as last tagged location.

# IHS
### Punchline
Streamlining & Digitizing In-house sequencing process for leading automobile manufacturer in India.
### Problem
Existing manual, error prone sequencing of parts, reduce TAT and errors, digitalize, centralized, sequencing of parts for PV assembly lines. Effective way to sequence using organized trolleys and visibility for coverage and reports.
### Solution
Trolley configuration, mapping MES live data received to trolleys on real time basis improved efficiency. Maintaining centralized data and configurations with part images help reduced cognitive load on the operating user increasing efficiency, transparency and accountability.
