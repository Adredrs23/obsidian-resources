Flat - simple, single & 2D table, no complex relnS
Hierarchical - tree like, root-child 
Network - inspired from H, complex m->M relnS
Relation - rows, columns, tables
Star - facts & dimensions - less joins required - denormalized
SnowFlake - expand dimensions - more joins required - more normalized

Star vs SnowFlake - https://hevodata.com/learn/star-and-snowflake-schema-analysis/

*Normalization is different from relationship types.*

Why & Which Schema.
1. How much data?
2. Data for analysis or Data for transactions?

When to prefer constraints for Databases and when it is safe to drop them?
