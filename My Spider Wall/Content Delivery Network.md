Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are primarily designed to cache static content, such as images, videos, and HTML pages, to improve website performance and reduce server load. However, CDNs can also handle dynamic content by using a technique called edge computing. In edge computing, the CDN servers can execute code and generate dynamic content in real-time, based on user requests. This is usually done by implementing serverless computing, which allows developers to run code snippets on the CDN servers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. For example, if a user requests a product page on an e-commerce website, the CDN server can fetch the latest product information from the origin server, generate the HTML page, and cache it for future requests. This approach can significantly improve website performance, reduce server load, and enhance user experience. However, it's worth noting that edge computing has some limitations, such as limited processing power and memory on the CDN servers. As a result, CDNs may not be suitable for handling complex or resource-intensive dynamic content, such as real-time video streaming or interactive web applications.
